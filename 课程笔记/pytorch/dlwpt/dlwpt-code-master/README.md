## About Deep Learning with PyTorch

This book has the aim of providing the foundations of deep learning with PyTorch and
showing them in action in a real-life project. We strive to provide the key concepts underlying deep learning and show how PyTorch puts them in the hands of practitioners. In
the book, we try to provide intuition that will support further exploration, and in doing
so we selectively delve into details to show what is going on behind the curtain.
Deep Learning with PyTorch doesn’t try to be a reference book; rather, it’s a conceptual companion that will allow you to independently explore more advanced material
online. As such, we focus on a subset of the features offered by PyTorch. The most
notable absence is recurrent neural networks, but the same is true for other parts of
the PyTorch API.

## Who should read this book

This book is meant for developers who are or aim to become deep learning practitioners and who want to get acquainted with PyTorch. We imagine our typical reader
to be a computer scientist, data scientist, or software engineer, or an undergraduateor-later student in a related program. Since we don’t assume prior knowledge of deep
learning, some parts in the first half of the book may be a repetition of concepts that
are already known to experienced practitioners. For those readers, we hope the exposition will provide a slightly different angle to known topics.
 We expect readers to have basic knowledge of imperative and object-oriented programming. Since the book uses Python, you should be familiar with the syntax and
operating environment. Knowing how to install Python packages and run scripts on
your platform of choice is a prerequisite. Readers coming from C++, Java, JavaScript,
Ruby, or other such languages should have an easy time picking it up but will need to
do some catch-up outside this book. Similarly, being familiar with NumPy will be useful, if not strictly required. We also expect familiarity with some basic linear algebra,
such as knowing what matrices and vectors are and what a dot product is.

## About the authors

Eli Stevens has spent the majority of his career working at startups in Silicon Valley,
with roles ranging from software engineer (making enterprise networking appliances)
to CTO (developing software for radiation oncology). At publication, he is working
on machine learning in the self-driving-car industry.

Luca Antiga worked as a researcher in biomedical engineering in the 2000s, and
spent the last decade as a cofounder and CTO of an AI engineering company. He has
contributed to several open source projects, including the PyTorch core. He recently
cofounded a US-based startup focused on infrastructure for data-defined software.

Thomas Viehmann is a machine learning and PyTorch specialty trainer and consultant based in Munich, Germany, and a PyTorch core developer. With a PhD in
mathematics, he is not scared by theory, but he is thoroughly practical when applying
it to computing challenges.
